# User Stories

This document contains the user stories for the Hello Vue Developer application.

## US001: Register a Developer

**As a** developer learning Vue,  
**I want** to register with my first and last names,  
**so that** I can be recognized as a Vue developer.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** no developer is currently registered, **when** a developer provides a valid first name and last name, **then** the system records the developerâ€™s details and acknowledges their registration.
- **Given** no developer is currently registered, **when** a developer provides a first name or last name containing only spaces, **then** the system rejects the registration and indicates valid names are required.
- **Given** no developer is currently registered, **when** a developer provides only a first name, **then** the system rejects the registration and indicates both names are required.
- **Given** no developer is currently registered, **when** a developer provides only a last name, **then** the system rejects the registration and indicates both names are required.

## US002: Greet Last Registered Developer

**As a** developer learning Vue,  
**I want** to be welcomed after registering,  
**so that** I feel encouraged to continue exploring Vue.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** a developer has registered with valid first and last names, **when** the system processes the registration, **then** the system greets the developer using their full name.
- **Given** no developer has registered, **when** the system starts, **then** the system does not provide any greeting.
- **Given** a developer was previously greeted, **when** another developer registers with valid names, **then** the system greets the new developer using their full name.

## US003: Track Valid Registrations

**As a** stakeholder monitoring participation,  
**I want** to know the number of developers who have registered with valid names,  
**so that** I can track engagement accurately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** the system is tracking registered developers, **when** a developer registers with valid first and last names, **then** the system increments the count of registered developers by one.
- **Given** the system is tracking registered developers, **when** a developer attempts to register with missing or spaces-only names, **then** the system does not increment the count.
- **Given** multiple developers have registered with valid names, **when** a new developer registers with valid names, **then** the system increments the count to reflect all valid registrations.

## US004: Defer Registration

**As a** developer learning Vue,  
**I want** to defer registering my details,  
**so that** I can explore the application without committing immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** the system allows registration, **when** a developer chooses to defer registration, **then** the system clears any current registration details and acknowledges the deferral.
- **Given** a developer was previously registered, **when** a developer chooses to defer registration, **then** the system stops acknowledging the previous registration.
- **Given** the system has deferred a registration, **when** a developer attempts to register later, **then** the system allows a new registration with valid names.
